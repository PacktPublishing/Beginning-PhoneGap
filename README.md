## About the Video Course
Do you want to write effective mobile applications without spending large amounts of time learning complex SDKs? PhoneGap provides the perfect solution. PhoneGap allows developers using web technics to write cross-platform mobile applications as well as mobile enterprise applications quickly and easily, with full native access and powerful web libraries.

This video course shows you how to build a fully functional mobile application with PhoneGap quickly and easily. You will begin by installing PhoneGap before moving on to learn how to use PhoneGap-related tools to host, develop, test, debug, build, and release mobile application libraries. You will then dive into the core of PhoneGap application development by learning how to use CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript/Framework, and the PhoneGap API from a mobile applicationâ€™s perspective. With the help of step-by-step examples, easily understandable code, and dynamic demos, you will be able to introduce mobile end-to-end solutions that integrate mobile apps into external services.

By the end of the course, you will know how to use PhoneGap in a convenient manner to write powerful and fascinating apps that run anywhere, quickly.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is divided into two broad sections. We first cover how to use the PhoneGap platform - generating a mobile native binary that wraps a web application and then using PhoneGap APIs to access native functions. We then work on optimizing your web skills and discussing best practices on code design, all while developing an interesting application at runtime.
